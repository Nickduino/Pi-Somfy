# Pi-Somfy

## 1 Overview

This project allows to operate multiple Somfy Shutter with a Raspberry Pi with cheap hardware costing less than $2. It comes with a command line interface, a web interface and an Amazon Alexa interface. 

## 2 Hardware

This project has been developed and tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 as the base platform. Since the serial port and network are the only external ports used, the program could be used on other platforms with minor modifications and testing.

In development and testing I used the Raspberry Pi3 both with Wi-Fi connectivity and Ethernet cable. Note that the hardware has to be reasonably close to the shutters you operate, as the signal strength will otherwise not be sufficient.

As of now, you have to build your own hardware. Here are the steps to do so.
1. You need the RF Transmitter. If you wish to order it from eBay, this link maybe helpful: <br/>[Order](https://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=5x+433Mhz+RF+transmitter+and+receiver+kit+Module+Arduino+ARM+WL+MCU+Raspberry).<br/>Note that I bricked my first Transmitter when soldering, so ordering more than one may be a good idea.
1. You need an oscillator for a 433.42 MHz frequency. The above RF transmitter comes with a common 433.93 MHz one, which will not work with your Somfy shutter. If you wish to order it from eBay, this link maybe helpful: <br/>[Order](https://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=433.42M+R433+F433+SAW+Resonator+Crystals+TO-39)
1. You will need cables to connect the transmitter to the Raspberry Pi. Any cable will do obviously, but I found these quite helpful. <br/>[Order](https://www.ebay.com/itm/40Pin-Multicolored-Dupont-Wire-Kits-Breadboard-Female-Jumper-Ribbon-Cable/113310899442)

Once you have all the hardware handy, now it's time to exchange the oscillator, which requires a bit of soldering. Reason for this is that the emitter you bought uses a common 433.93 MHz frequency, Somfy however requires a 433.__42__ MHz frequency. Take the following 3 easy steps to exchange the oscillator
1. Identify the oscillator. It looks like this (marked with a red circle): <br/>![Front view](documentation/RF%20Transmitter%20front.jpg). <br/>Turn the RF Transmitter around. You will see that the oscillator is soldered in on 3 points <br/>![Back View](documentation/RF%20Transmitter%20back.jpg). 
1. While pulling the oscillator from the front, heat up the 3 soldering point on the back with the soldering iron until the oscillator is detached from the board. 
1. Now put in the new oscillator (make sure all 3 pins connect through the print) and solder it in again.

And you are done! As mentioned above, I got step 3 wrong the first time round. One of the pins was not properly connected and I was lucky I ordered spare emitters and oscillators

Now the last step is to connect you adjusted RF transmitter to your Raspberry Pi. Use the following diagram to help you connect it 

![Diagram](documentation/Wiring%20Diagram.png)

Note that I used GPIO 4 but you can change the value of __TXGPIO__ to whatever you want if you choose a different way to connect your RF emitter. This is a configuration parameter in operateShutters.conf.

OK. now this all should look like this. Note that some of the pictures are a bit confusing with regards to which GPIO a cable connects to. The above diagram easier to see. But if you struggle, maybe the [Wiring Diagram](documentation/Wiring%20Diagram.txt) helps.

## 3 Software

If you are new to using a Raspberry Pi and Linux please refer to other sources for coming up to speed with the environment. Having a base knowledge will go a long way. This [site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/) is a great place to start if you are new to these topics.

If you are not familiar with remote login commands for Linux/Unix, two useful commands if you are not using a GUI on your raspberry pi are "ssh" and "scp". These commands allow you to run your Pi without a monitor or user interface. These programs allow you to remotely login to your Pi and remotely transfer files to your Pi. This [page](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/ssh-and-scp-howto-tips-tricks/) describes both programs. You can also do a web search on these programs to find other resources on their use. In short you need to have at minimum a basic understanding of using a command line, preferably some experience with Linux and the ability to transfer files to a Raspberry Pi and execute them.

The Raspberry Pi organization has documentation on installing an operating system on your Raspberry Pi. It is located [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).

So ssh into your Raspberry Pi and you should find that you are in the directory /home/pi. 

The next step is to download the Pi-Somfy project files to your Raspberry Pi. The easiest way to do this is to use the "git" program. Most Raspberry Pi distributions include the git program (except Debian Lite). If your distribution does not include git then type:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git

Once git is installed on your system, make sure you are in the /home/pi directory, then type:

    git clone https://github.com/MichaelB2018/Pi-Somfy.git

The above command will make a directory in /home/pi named Pi-Somfy and put the project files in this directory.

Next, we need to install Python Libraries. Before doing so, you have to decide whether you want to run Pi-Somfy in Python 2 or Python 3. The library supports both, but Python 3 is suggested. So, to proceed in Python 3, you need to ensure pip3 is installed: 

If the program 'pip3' is not installed on your system, type:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    
If you decided to use Python 2, the last command will read instead:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

Next, we need to install the PIGPIO libraries, to do so, type:

    sudo apt-get install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio

Next install the required Python Libraries:

    sudo pip3 install ephem configparser Flask
   
If you decided to use Python 2, the last command will read instead:

    sudo pip install ephem configparser Flask

Next, let's test if it all works. Start <operateShutters.py> by typing:

    sudo /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py

You should see the help text explaining the [Command Line Interface](documentation/p4.png)

## 4 Usage

Note that the config file won't exists the first time you run the application. In that case, a new config file will be reated based on the name you specified (e.g. /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf).

You have 4 ways to operate. The recommended operations mode is mode 4. But the other 3 modes are explained here for completeness:

1. Command line Interface<br/>You can use either of the following commands to operate a shutter called corridor<br/>   
The first one will raise the shutter. The second one will lower the shutter. The third one - **without starting the web interface** - will lower the shutter at sunset and raise it again 60 minutes after sunrise.
```csh
sudo /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py corridor -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -u
sudo /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py corridor -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -d
sudo /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py corridor -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -dd 0 60
``` 

2. Manually start Web interface only<br/>You can start the web-interface by typing:<br/>Once started, you can access the web interface at http://IPaddressOfYouPi:80. From there you can further modify your settings.   
```csh
    sudo /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -a 
```    

3. Manually start Web interface and Alexa interface<br/>You can start the web-interface by typing:
```csh
    sudo /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -a -e
```    

4. Finally, the recommended way to operate it is using crontab on boot time. You can do so by typing:
```csh
    sudo crontab –e 
```
Note, that "crontab -e" will just open a console-based text editor that you can edit the crontab script. The first time you run "crontab -e" you will be prompted to choose the editor. I recommend nano. From the crontab window, add the following to the bottom of the crontab script

    @reboot sleep 60;/home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -a -e
    0 * * * * /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.py -c /home/pi/Pi-Somfy/operateShutters.conf -a -e 

And save the crontab schedule. (if using nano type press ctrl-o to save the file, ctrl-x to exit nano). Now, every time your system is booted operateShutters will start.

The program is not known to crash. Hence restarting it every hour is not really required. But it does not hurt either. So up to you if you wish to use both of the above lines or just the first one. In any case, you will need to restart your Raspberry Pi once you have completed step 4. To do so, type "sudo reboot". 

To stop the program from running in the background, type:

    sudo pkill –f operateShutters.py  

## 5 Web GUI

Using your web-browser, navigate to: http://IPaddressOfYouPi:80

First time you use the Web GUI, it's important that you follow these 3 steps:

1. Set up your location. This is required to correctly determine the time of sunrise and sunset. To do so, navigate to the top menu item "Settings". Use the map to pinpoint your location. You can also use the search functionality on the left-hand side (magnifier icon) and type your address. Press "Save"

1. You will need to set up your shutters and program your remote control. To do so, select the second menu item "Add/Remove Shutters". <br/>![Screenshot](documentation/p1.png)<br/>
Click the "Add" button, select the name for your shutter (this is also the name that the Amazon Alexa app will use later) and click on the "save" icon. Then follow the on-screen instructions for programming your shutter.

1. Next, make sure your shutters work. The easiest way to verify is to use the "Manual Operations" menu. <br/>![Screenshot](documentation/p2.png)<br/> You can rise and lower your shutters by clicking on the relevant icons.

1. Finally, it's time to program your shutters schedule. To do so, use the "Scheduled Operations" menu. <br/>![Screenshot](documentation/p3.png)<br/>


## 6 Alexa Integration

Before you can use the Amazon Alexa integration, you need to make sure you set up all shutters, by using "Add/Remove Shutters" in the Web GUI. **Amazon Alexa does not automatically discover new or amended shutters you have added**. 

So once all your shutters are set up and testing on the Web GUI, go to your Echo speaker and ask Alexa to discover your device. Say, "Discover my devices," or select Add Device in the Devices section of the Alexa app.

Once Alexa has discovered your shutters, you can use the Alexa app to complete the setup. 

To lower your shutter via the Echo speaker, say "Alexa, turn on {SHUTTERNAME}". And to rise the shutter again, say “Alexa, turn off {SHUTTERNAME}".

If you prefer to state the likes of "Alexa, OPEN the shutter" or "Alexa, CLOSE the shutter" (rather than using the words ON or OFF), you can set up a Routine with Alexa.
